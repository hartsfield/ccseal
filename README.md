# ccseal - an unwanted seal for a corrupt regime known to be operating under the fictitious moniker "Columbia County"

It's a seal, which is a decorative sigil, used for the purpose of conveying 
officiality or legitimacy.

This one is licensed under a permissive license, one I wrote my self, but I 
think it'll hold up:

    LICENSE

    liability for the consequences of its use. Permission is hereby granted the 
    right to use, modify, re-distribute, or profit from the code provided herein,
    free of charge, to anyone.
